# Algorithms and Data Structures
## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Algorithms:
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure used to solve a problem or perform a computation. It is a well-defined sequence of instructions that takes some input and produces an output. Algorithms are crucial in computer science as they form the basis for solving various computational problems efficiently.

### 1.2 Algorithms as a technology:
Algorithms can be thought of as a technology because they are tools that enable us to perform computations. They provide us with a systematic approach to solve problems and can be implemented in various programming languages. By studying algorithms, we can develop techniques to analyze and compare their efficiency.
