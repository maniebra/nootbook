# Algorithms and Data Structure
## 4. Divide-and-Conquer

### 4.1 The maximum-subarray problem:
The maximum-subarray problem is a classic example of a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Given an array of numbers, the task is to find the subarray with the largest sum. Here's how the algorithm works step-by-step:

Divide the array into two halves.
Recursively find the maximum subarray sum in the left and right halves.
Find the maximum subarray sum that crosses the midpoint.
Return the maximum of the three sums.
For example, let's consider the array [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4].

- Step 1: Divide the array into two halves: [-2, 1, -3, 4] and [-1, 2, 1, -5, 4].
- Step 2: Recursively find the maximum subarray sums in the left and right halves. In the left half, the maximum subarray sum is 4, and in the right half, it is 7.
- Step 3: Find the maximum subarray sum that crosses the midpoint. In this case, the sum is 6 ([4, -1, 2, 1]).
- Step 4: Return the maximum of the three sums, which is 7.
### 4.2 The substitution method for solving recurrences:
When analyzing the time complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms, we often encounter recursive equations known as recurrences. The substitution method is a technique used to solve these recurrences. Here's how it works step-by-step:

Make an educated guess for the solution to the recurrence.
Use mathematical induction to prove that the guess is correct.
Solve for any unknown constants in the solution.
### 4.3 The recursion-tree method for solving recurrences:
The recursion-tree method is another technique for solving recurrences. It involves visualizing the recursive calls as a tree and analyzing the total cost of the algorithm by summing up the costs at each level of the tree.

### 4.4 The master method for solving recurrences:
The master method is a handy tool for solving recurrences of a specific form. It provides a simple formula to determine the time complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms without going through the detailed analysis. The master method has three cases, depending on the relationship between the subproblem size and the work done at each level of recursion.

### 4.5 Proof of the master theorem:
The master theorem is derived from a proof that uses mathematical induction and some mathematical properties. The proof demonstrates the correctness of the master theorem and its applicability to solving recurrences of the specified form.

### 4.6 C++ Example for Maximum Subarray:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits>

// Function to find the maximum subarray sum that crosses the midpoint
int maxCrossingSum(std::vector<int>& arr, int low, int mid, int high) {
    int left_sum = std::numeric_limits<int>::min();
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = mid; i >= low; --i) {
        sum += arr[i];
        if (sum > left_sum) {
            left_sum = sum;
        }
    }

    int right_sum = std::numeric_limits<int>::min();
    sum = 0;
    for (int i = mid + 1; i <= high; ++i) {
        sum += arr[i];
        if (sum > right_sum) {
            right_sum = sum;
        }
    }

    return left_sum + right_sum;
}

// Recursive function to find the maximum subarray sum
int maxSubarraySum(std::vector<int>& arr, int low, int high) {
    if (low == high) {
        return arr[low];
    }

    int mid = (low + high) / 2;

    int left_sum = maxSubarraySum(arr, low, mid);
    int right_sum = maxSubarraySum(arr, mid + 1, high);
    int cross_sum = maxCrossingSum(arr, low, mid, high);

    return std::max(std::max(left_sum, right_sum), cross_sum);
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4};
    int n = arr.size();

    int max_sum = maxSubarraySum(arr, 0, n - 1);

    std::cout << "Maximum subarray sum: " << max_sum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
